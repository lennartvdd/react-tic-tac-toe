A tick-tack-toe game written in React in order to learn some of the basics of react. 
Based on the [React](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) tutorial, unfinished (without the time machine) but also with some improvements:  
* The rows and columns are dynamic instead of hardcoded.
* The size of the board is dynamic and can be set to something other than 3x3 (size setting is hardcoded)
* All the possible solutions, horizontal, vertical and diagonal are automatically calculated instead of hardcoded
